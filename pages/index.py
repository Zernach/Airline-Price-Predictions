            ## ðŸ›© How are airline flight prices calculated?

            Have you ever bought a plane ticket to get you from point A-to-B, and then wondered why you've been charged that price?
            
            Unless you use a ticket price comparison platform, you're usually stuck paying the magic number that's calculated when you select your flight specifications.
            
            Hopefully after interactiving with this web app and experimenting with my flight price predictor, you'll more clearly understand how flight pricing works.
