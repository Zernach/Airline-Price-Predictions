            #### **üõ© HOW ARE AIRLINE FLIGHT PRICES CALCULATED?**

            Have you ever bought a plane ticket to get you from point A-to-B, and then wondered why you've been charged that price?
            
            Unless you use a ticket price comparison platform, you're usually stuck paying the magic number that's calculated when you select your flight specifications.
            
            After interactively experimenting with my flight price predictor web app, hopefully you'll more clearly understand how flight pricing works.
