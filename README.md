* Here's my Google [Colab file](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1s3SJs2dpnH2LQvR9S3JNH2C-yD1na_4R?usp=sharing), where I gathered, cleaned, analyzed, modeled my prediction algorithm.
* After cleaning the data, I [uploaded the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zernach/2018-airplane-flights) to Kaggle for others to use, which has since been downloaded 500+ times by others in the Kaggle community!
